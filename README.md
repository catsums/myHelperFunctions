# myHelperFunctions
 A package for my helper functions in Node

These are more like a dependancy for my other NPM modules and this started off as a way to test out advanced NPM stuff. If you wish to use this, **I rather recommend better and more versatile packages** like [Lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash) or [Underscore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/underscore).
